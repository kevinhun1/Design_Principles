# Solid Design Principles - Code Examples

This repository contains simple Java code examples demonstrating the SOLID design principles. Each principle is illustrated with both a violation and a correct implementation.

## Folder Structure

- **Single-Responsibility/**
  - `SRPViolationSimple.java`: Shows a class (`Rectangle`) that violates the Single Responsibility Principle by handling both data and display logic.
  - `SRPViolationReport.java`: Demonstrates SRP violation with a `Report` class that manages both report data and file saving.
  - `e1.java`: Correct implementation of SRP, separating user data (`User`) from display logic (`UserPrinter`).
  - `e2.java`: Example of a simple `User` class (may be used for SRP demonstration).

## How to Use

- Review each file to understand how the SOLID principles are applied or violated.
- Use these examples as a reference for learning or teaching SOLID design principles in Java.

## Principles Covered

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class should have only one reason to change.
- (Add more folders and files for other SOLID principles as you expand the repository.)
