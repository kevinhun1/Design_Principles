# Group Task Submission - Group 2

This repository provides simple Java code examples to illustrate the SOLID design principles. Each principle is demonstrated with both a violation and a correct implementation, making it easy to understand the importance of each principle in object-oriented design. The examples are organized for clarity and can be used as a reference for learning or teaching SOLID principles.

## Principles Covered

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
